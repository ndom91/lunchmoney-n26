# üí∞ Lunchmoney + N26 Sync - Cloudflare Worker

Sync your N26 Bank Account with your Lunchmoney account.

> **Current Status**: This is currently half baked as I realized during testing that N26 now makes you confirm logins on your mobile phone via their app, so this can't run completely headless anymore. The user would need to confirm every run on their mobile.. So I'm debating whether thats worth it or if N26's easy CSV export and Lunchboxes even easier CSV import is more suitable.

## üöÄ Setup

There are a few steps to get this working, for access to each service you will need the following:

1. Lunchmoney - API Token
2. N26 - Login Credentials (username / password)

We will store these in Cloudflare Worker environment secrets.

Once you've gotten your credentials ready, we can begin by using Cloudflare's `wrangler` tool to initiate a new worker based on this repository  

`wrangler init lunchmoney-sync https://github.com/ndom91/lunchmoney-n26`

Once it is created, we'll need to add the secrets

```
wrangler secret put N26_USER <username>
wrangler secret put N26_PASS <password>
wrangler secret put LUNCHMONEY_TOKEN <token>
```

These can then be accessed as global variables in your worker.

Finally, you can simply `publish` this repo. Make sure you're in the root of the repository and run

```
wrangler publish
```

Finally, in the Cloudflare Worker dashboard, select the `Triggers` tab, and setup a cron trigger. You can set it to run once per day, once per week, etc. whatever you feel like fits your needs best.
